# LILYGO-S3-pinout-on-screen

To know which pin is what when you put it on a breadboard, i made a picture which you can load / make vissible on the TFT screen of the ESP-S3 module.
This prevents making a mistake.
Which i made a couple of times because the pinout picture from LILYGO is from the bottum side , and therefor mirrored.
